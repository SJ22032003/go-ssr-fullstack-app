# Go SSR Fullstack Application

This is a fullstack application that provides complete server-side rendering (SSR) using Go, Gin, Templ, and HTMX.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: A statically typed, compiled language with a clean syntax and garbage collection. It's used for the backend of this application.
- **Gin**: A HTTP web framework written in Go. It features a martini-like API with performance that's up to 40 times faster.
- **Templ**: A lightweight, fast, and flexible templating engine in Go. It's used to generate the HTML views for this application.
- **HTMX**: A modern HTML-first approach to AJAX. It allows you to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, without having to write any JavaScript.
